# GitHub Setup Guide for FoundryX

Your FoundryX project is now ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `foundryx` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "FoundryX - Advanced YouTube Analytics Platform with AI-powered insights"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the repository URL. Copy it and run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Alternative - Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create and push in one go:

```bash
# Create repository and push (will prompt for repository details)
gh repo create foundryx --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all 47 files uploaded
3. Check that sensitive files like `.env` are NOT visible (they should be ignored)

## Important Security Notes

✅ **Safe to upload:**
- All source code files
- Documentation files (README.md, USER_GUIDE.md, etc.)
- Configuration templates (.env.example)
- Requirements and setup files

❌ **NOT uploaded (protected by .gitignore):**
- `.env` file (contains your API keys)
- Database files
- Cache and temporary files
- IDE-specific files

## Next Steps After Upload

1. **Update README**: Add your GitHub repository URL to the README
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional): For documentation hosting
3. **Set up GitHub Actions** (optional): For automated testing
4. **Add collaborators** (if needed): Invite team members
5. **Create releases**: Tag stable versions

## Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:
```
foundryx/
├── src/                    # Source code
├── tests/                  # Test files
├── docs/                   # Documentation
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── app.py                 # Main application
├── README.md              # Project overview
├── USER_GUIDE.md          # User documentation
├── OAUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md # OAuth help
└── .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "remote origin already exists"**
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

**Error: "failed to push"**
- Make sure the repository exists on GitHub
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the repository URL is correct

**Error: "authentication failed"**
- Use a personal access token instead of password
- Or use SSH keys for authentication

**Ready to push!** Your local repository is fully prepared with:
- ✅ Git initialized
- ✅ All files added and committed
- ✅ .gitignore configured for security
- ✅ 47 files ready for upload

Just follow Step 1 and Step 2 above to complete the GitHub upload!
